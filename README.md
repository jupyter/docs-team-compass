# Jupyter Documentation Working Group

The Docs Working Group serves as a support, helper, and advisory body to Jupyter subprojects on all aspects of documentation. The core pillars of our mission:

- Improve all aspects of documentation across the Jupyter ecosystem
- Make high quality documentation that is clear, comprehensive, inclusive, and serves the varying needs of Jupyter's diverse community
- Engage with the community to help users with Jupyter products, discover their needs, and connect them with relevant information, expertise and resources

If you'd like to contact the members, you can email [jupyter-docs-working-group@googlegroups.com](mailto:jupyter-docs-working-group@googlegroups.com).
